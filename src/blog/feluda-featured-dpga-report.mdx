The DPGA and UNDP teamed up in late 2022 and early 2023 to promote the transformative power of technology by surfacing OSS that can help strengthen information integrity. Well-designed, open-source tools can not only be adapted to meet context-specific needs but also offer the distinct advantage of easy adoption, making them suitable for diverse environments.

Feluda was one of these OSS, and is designed to understand native multimedia content in Indian languages. It can be used to conduct image and video searches on Indian fact-checking sites, generate analytical reports on content circulating on platforms like WhatsApp, and answer questions like what themes are present in a multimodal dataset. The engine is a valuable resource for any team seeking to understand large volumes of multilingual and multimodal content, aiding in the fight against information pollution particularly for fact-checking, research, and data science.

The report underscores the enduring relevance of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the pivotal role DPGs play in achieving them by 2030. With a renewed focus on responsible and ethical use, the DPGA emphasizes the importance of open-source solutions as antidotes to the challenges associated with digitization, with DPGs emerging as critical components for building and maintaining equitable digital ecosystems.

In 2023, governments globally increasingly recognized the importance of DPGs, with discussions at the 78th UN General Assembly and their central role in India's G20 Presidency. The DPG Charter process, co-led by the DPGA and DIAL with support from various entities, concluded successfully, garnering endorsements from over 20 organizations. This year reaffirmed the DPGA's commitment to ensuring DPGs are safe, secure, and serve the public good.

Looking ahead to 2024, the DPGA remains steadfast in advocating for the adoption of DPGs and open-source technologies in countries' digital public infrastructure efforts.
